# Personal dotfiles

Dotfiles managed via stow, and used in my install and update scripts.

# TODO

* [x] Write script to check node version and update via pnpm
* [x] Find and replace needs some testing, had to change a bit last update
* [x] Need to standardise moving between tmux windows and nvim windows
* [x] Move api shortcut commands out to their own lib
* [ ] Automatically run `set_node_version` function to happen when it detects a file and can update

# Roadmap

Thinking bundle my dotfiles and my build script together.
